This is an open source project, free feel to look at it and run it. In order to run it, follow the following steps:

Running the project involves three main steps, which must be done in order.

First, open your terminal or command prompt and make sure you are inside your main project folder (railway-ticket-predictor/).

Step 1: Install the Required Libraries
This command reads the requirements.txt file and installs all the necessary Python libraries for the project to work.

Step 2: Train the Machine Learning Model
This command runs the train.py script. It will read your CSV data, train the PyTorch model, and save the final model files (.pth and .joblib) into the models folder.

You will see output in your terminal showing the training progress and the final accuracy of the model.

Step 3: Run the Web Application
This is the final step. It executes the run.py file, which starts the Flask web server.

After you run this, you will see some output in the terminal, including a line that looks like this:
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

Step 4: View Your Project
Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and go to the address from the terminal:


Viola! You should see your Railway Ticket Predictor website live and ready to use.
